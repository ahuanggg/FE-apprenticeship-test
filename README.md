# FE-apprenticeship-test

# Description
This is my Front End apprenticeship test for fetch. It is a form that pulls data from an API and pushes the completed form to another.

# How to run
I used live server extention on Visual Studio Code to run the HTML with the JavaScript. You can do the same or upload it to a server to run it.
